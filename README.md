# AutoBusy

My implementation of a well known concept: automatically setting your character in Do Not Disturb mode in WoW, with a custom message, upon login. It will monitor changes in status and enforce Do Not Disturb mode if your status change.

## Usage

`/eab Custom Do not Disturb message to show players who whisper you.`
